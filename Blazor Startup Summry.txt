How It All Connects
_Host.cshtml:

Acts as the entry point of your Blazor Server app and is served when someone navigates to the root URL (/).
It specifies that the layout to use is _Layout.cshtml.
_Layout.cshtml:

Contains the common HTML structure (like headers and footers) used throughout your application.
It has a placeholder (usually @Body) where the content of _Host.cshtml will be rendered.
App.razor:

Defines the main layout and routing for your Blazor application.
Specifies which components to display based on the URL.
Rendering Process:

When the user accesses the root URL, _Host.cshtml is loaded.
_Host.cshtml uses _Layout.cshtml for layout.
Inside _Host.cshtml, the <component> tag renders the App component.
The App component manages routing and displays the appropriate page/component based on the URL.

Summary
_Host.cshtml serves as the main entry point for the Blazor Server app, including the App component.
_Layout.cshtml provides a consistent layout (header, footer) for all pages.
App.razor handles routing and layout selection for different pages.
This setup ensures that your Blazor Server app is organized and that users get a consistent layout and fast initial page load.
